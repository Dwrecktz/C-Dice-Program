# C-Dice-Program
Simple Console App. Press enter to roll a die, numbers are between 1-6.

# How to use:
Downlod VsCode or Visual Studio. Create a new C# Console App Project. Copy and paste the Program.cs file into your project, and then change the namespace to whatever you want.

# Running:
Press F5 on your keyboard (or run), and then it will run the program. Press enter to roll a random number between 1-6. Additionally, you could build the project, to create an easy to access exe. This will make it so you don't need to go intk the code editor and hit run everytime.

# Modification:
To change the number range of the die, you can go inside the for loop. In there, you'll see the code: `roll = numberGen.Next(1, 7);` Change 1 To the minimum number, and 7 to one number above the maximum number you want.
